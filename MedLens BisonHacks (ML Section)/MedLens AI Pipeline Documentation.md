# MedLens — AI Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

MedLens uses a multi-stage AI pipeline to transform complex medical documents into plain-language summaries that patients can understand, act on, and trust — in their own language.

## Why AI Is Necessary at Each Stage

Each AI component solves a specific, essential problem:

- **OCR (Tesseract.js):** Enables accessibility — patients can photograph documents instead of typing. Without OCR, the tool is limited to digitally-generated text only, excluding the majority of real-world medical documents patients receive as printouts.

- **Medical NLP (GPT-4o-mini):** Enables comprehension — medical documents are written at a college reading level, but 36% of U.S. adults have limited health literacy. The LLM translates medical jargon ("PO BID", "acute exacerbation", "subcutaneous") into plain language at three reading levels simultaneously, generates a daily medication schedule, and translates everything into the patient's preferred language.

- **Drug Interaction Analysis (OpenFDA + GPT-4o-mini):** Enables safety — the FDA API returns dense clinical text that patients cannot parse. A second LLM call summarizes each interaction into 1-2 plain-language sentences specific to the patient's medication list. Without this, patients must rely on catching dangerous interactions themselves.

- **Voice I/O (Web Speech API):** Enables inclusion — patients with low literacy, visual impairments, or limited dexterity can speak their medical information and hear results read aloud. Zero dependencies, built into modern browsers.

## Reading Level Control

MedLens generates all three reading levels in a single API call, enabling instant client-side switching with no additional latency:

| Level | Target | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Simple | 5th grade | Short sentences, no medical terms, most accessible |
| Standard | 8th grade | Some medical terms with definitions in parentheses |
| Detailed | 12th grade | Preserves clinical detail with explanations |

## Multilingual Support

MedLens supports 6 languages with full UI translation:

| Language | Code | UI Headings | AI Content |
|----------|------|-------------|------------|
| English | en | ✅ | ✅ |
| Spanish | es | ✅ | ✅ |
| French | fr | ✅ | ✅ |
| Chinese | zh | ✅ | ✅ |
| Korean | ko | ✅ | ✅ |
| Vietnamese | vi | ✅ | ✅ |

When a user switches language, the LLM re-processes the original document text. All UI headings (tabs, buttons, labels, time-of-day labels) switch instantly via a client-side translations object. Medication names are preserved in English to maintain clinical accuracy and enable drug interaction lookups.

## Medication Schedule Generator

The LLM automatically organizes extracted medications into a daily schedule:

- **Morning** — medications taken with breakfast or upon waking
- **Afternoon** — midday medications
- **Evening** — medications taken with dinner
- **Bedtime** — nighttime medications and injections

This is generated from the medication frequency data in the document (e.g., "PO BID with meals" → morning + evening).

## OCR Confidence Scoring

The pipeline returns a confidence score (0-100%) for image-based inputs:

- **80-100%:** High confidence — results are reliable
- **60-79%:** Medium confidence — user is prompted to verify information
- **Below 60%:** Low confidence — user is advised to retake the photo or type text directly

This transparency helps users understand when to trust the output and when to seek clarification.

## Drug Interaction Intelligence

Unlike simple database lookups, MedLens uses a two-step approach:

1. **OpenFDA query** — retrieves raw drug interaction label data for each medication
2. **LLM summarization** — GPT-4o-mini reads the dense FDA text and produces a 1-2 sentence plain-language warning, filtering for interactions relevant to the patient's specific medication list

Example transformation:
- **FDA raw text:** "Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 as well as OCT2 transporter. Sulfamethoxazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Caution is recommended when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is co-administered with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 and 2C9 or OCT2..."
- **MedLens output:** "No specific interactions found with your other medications, but consult your doctor about potential effects on blood sugar when taking Metformin."

## Ethical Safeguards

- **Disclaimer:** Every response includes a mandatory disclaimer that MedLens is informational only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
- **Non-medical detection:** The pipeline identifies and rejects non-medical documents rather than producing misleading medical interpretations.
- **No data storage:** Documents are processed client-side and via API in real-time — nothing is stored on any server.
- **Transparency:** OCR confidence scores are surfaced to the user, not hidden.
- **Medication name preservation:** Drug names stay in English across all languages to prevent translation errors that could endanger patients.

## Input Methods

MedLens accepts medical documents through 5 input methods:

1. **Camera capture** — photograph a physical document using device camera
2. **File upload** — upload an image or PDF from device storage
3. **Paste text** — copy-paste from patient portals or digital records
4. **Voice input** — read the document aloud or describe medical information verbally
5. **Sample demo** — pre-loaded discharge summary for demonstration

## JSON Output Contract

Every analysis returns this structure:

```json

## Community Impact

MedLens addresses a critical health equity gap in Washington, D.C.:

- **36% of U.S. adults** have limited health literacy (NAAL)
- **Wards 7 and 8** in D.C. face the highest rates of chronic disease and lowest access to digital health resources
- **Language barriers** affect 25% of D.C. households where English is not the primary language
- **Medication non-adherence** costs the U.S. healthcare system $528 billion annually, often driven by patients not understanding their prescriptions

MedLens makes medical documents accessible to everyone — regardless of reading level, language, or digital literacy.
